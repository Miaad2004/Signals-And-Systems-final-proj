# Signals and Systems Final Project
> This repository contains the final project for the Signals and Systems course at university of isfahan. The project consists of three MATLAB assignments about signal processing and image processing.

## Project 1: Audio Signal Filtering
This project processes an audio signal with noise and applies a low-pass filter to remove high-frequency noises.

- Loads a noisy audio signal.
- Designs a low-pass filter using MATLAB’s `fdatool`.
- Applies the filter to the signal and generates a denoised audio file.

## Project 2: Image Denoising Using Median Filter
This project applies median filtering to remove salt-and-pepper noise from a given image.

- Applies median filtering with different kernel sizes (3×3, 5×5, 7×7, 9×9).
- Determines the best filtering result based on visual quality.
- Compares the effects of different filter sizes.

## Project 3: Image Quantization
This project reduces the number of intensity levels in a grayscale image to simulate different bit-depth representations.

- Applies quantization with different intensity levels (64, 32, 16, 8, 4, and 2 levels).
- Visualizes the effects of quantization.
